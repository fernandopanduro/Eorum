                        <p className='paragrath'>Please note that processing time (1-2 business days) is different from shipping time and should be added to the total delivery time.

                        <p className='paragrath'>Processing Time - in very rare instances, may take longer than the stated expected time frame. During busy time like holidays, promotions or other instances processing time might take longer. We do our best to deliver as fast as possible and seek your understanding and patience during such events.</p>

                        <p className='paragrath'>Buyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. In some cases, there will be VAT (Value Added Tax), other taxes, customs and/or duty fees levied by your destination country. These additional charges are not included and are the responsibility of the recipient. We cannot determine the charges since customs and taxation policies vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office if you have any questions. We do not refund shipping costs for customers that reject their packages upon arrival for failure to pay duty fees.</p>
                        <p className='paragrath'>Customs clearance procedures may be required; under these circumstances, delays may occur, which will affect our original delivery time. Delivery time of orders can be extended by delivery service for indefinite period for reasons beyond our control.</p>
